## HI, I'M LONGKANG

I'm a PhD student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised byÂ [Dr. Xiaolin Zhu](https://xzhu-lab.github.io/Pride/). In the last few years my work has focused on Semantic Segmentation and Cloud Detection in Multispectral Images. Currently, I'm doing research in the intersection of Earth Observation, Computer Vision, and Cognitive Psychology, improving human-deep learning collaboration in earth observation. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking and badminton.
